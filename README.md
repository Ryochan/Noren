It is really easy to use! 3 steps and it's good to go :)

2. Create a UIView which comfirms to the protocol `NorenViewType` and design it in any way you like

  __protocol NorenViewType has two properties__
  - `norenInformation`
  - `onTap`

3. Create a NorenView and define what you want to do when on tap and how long you want it to be displayed.
```swift
  let norenView = NorenManager.createNorenView(designedView, norenInformation: NorenInformation(body: "You have new messages"))
                                              //Your designed view comes here. *It has to comform to `NorenViewType`
  norenView 
      .onTap {
        //implement what you want to do when on tap here.
      }
      .show(duration: 2.0)
